I wanted to explain that that’s so fucking unfair because they could eat a regular damn cheese pizza from the other place!!! but i can eat nothing from this one.

Although a part of me has also thought about all of the products I have purchased, all of the things I own and buy that were unethically created, and I just don't know about it.

Since vegan dating apps (which can also be used to find friends) are largely unpopulated (i.e. Veggly and VegPal), I think having a pinned post would be great to help those such as myself find vegans to connect with. I think the rules for said post can be as simple as posting what you are looking for (romantic partner, friends, business partners, etc), age, and gender.

I would freak when my mom would “wash the chicken” or that the spoon she used to stir my food was also used in their animal products. Or that the cutting board wasn’t cleaned right after they were cutting raw meat. My roommate and I are both vegan and now I don’t have to worry about getting salmonella or some shit. All I gotta do is wash my veggies! Long gone are the days of moldy cheese in the fridge or meat liquid leaking into the veggie crisper.
