# Vegan WordCloud

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Vegan WordCloud project! This repository contains code to generate a WordCloud visualization based on text data extracted from Reddit posts related to veganism.

## Overview

- `vegan-thumbnail.png`: Thumbnail image used as a mask for the WordCloud visualization.
- `Vegan WordCloud.png`: Output image file containing the generated WordCloud.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository and instructions for using the WordCloud generator.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the `Vegan_WordCloud.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and generate the WordCloud.
4. Customize the code as needed to modify the data preprocessing steps, adjust parameters for the WordCloud generator, or use different text data sources.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `PIL`, `gensim`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`, `nltk`
